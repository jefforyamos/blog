      <description>Ezekiel addressed as Son of Man 63 times The book of Ezekiel is chunked full of examples in which Yehovah addresses him as Son of Man. One example from Ezekiel 2:6-8
And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions.[fn] Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.</description>
