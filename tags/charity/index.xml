      <description>There is a foundational Christian doctrine that is often stated:
Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.
The primary source for the doctrine is Hebrews 9:22.
According to Yehovah, charity and righteousness atone for sin.
Proverbs 10:2 - righteousness delivers from death Proverbs 11:4 - delivers from death Proverbs 16:6 - steadfast love atones for iniquity Proverbs 21:3 - superior to blood sacrifice in His eyes Hosea 6:6 - what he really desires Daniel 4:27 - Lengthens prosperity </description>

      <description>The opening section does a good job introducing generosity using the example of Warren Buffet, who is said to give 99% of his income away. However, it&amp;rsquo;s pointed out he is an agnostic and generosity is a &amp;ldquo;heart issue&amp;rdquo;, I suppose implying he is lacking the right heart. It concludes by identifying the target.
In our study, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how God&amp;rsquo;s abundant grace moves us toward a generous lifestyle.
Well, that sounds good.</description>
