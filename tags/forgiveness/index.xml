      <description>Christianity is eager to tie their claim to the &amp;ldquo;New Covenant&amp;rdquo; back to Jeremiah 31:31 in spite of some problems. However, the unmistakable link between Jeremiah 31:33 and Deuteronomy 30:6, both referring to the deployment of the law being written on their hearts&amp;hellip;.well, that is something they don&amp;rsquo;t really want to talk about.
Why?
Well, I can think of a reason or two&amp;hellip;
The Deuteronomy text depicts the original Torah returning to the hearts and minds of people in Deu 30:1, and Christianity is deeply invested in a divestment in the &amp;ldquo;old law&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Theme and targeted passages We can receive no greater gift than a relationship with God.
Targeted passages: Romans 5:6-11,18-21
I agree with the opening thesis above. I strongly question whether the targeted passages give us the means to achieve that.
I might have started with something like Isaiah 56.
Keeping the law is impossible - Romans 5:6-8 The quarterly does a wonderful job making something perfectly clear about Romans 5:6-8. On page 46, we find the following commentary:</description>

      <title>Why is atonement by righteousness and charity ignored?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/charity-atones-for-sin/</link>

      <description>There is a foundational Christian doctrine that is often stated:
Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.
The primary source for the doctrine is Hebrews 9:22.
According to Yehovah, charity and righteousness atone for sin.
Proverbs 10:2 - righteousness delivers from death Proverbs 11:4 - delivers from death Proverbs 16:6 - steadfast love atones for iniquity Proverbs 21:3 - superior to blood sacrifice in His eyes Hosea 6:6 - what he really desires Daniel 4:27 - Lengthens prosperity </description>

      <title>Paralytic story - Where Is Shed Blood?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/paralytic-where-is-shed-blood/</link>

      <description>There is a doctrine that is often stated:
Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.
Though the primary source is Hebrews 9:22, secondary sources for the doctrine would be Ephesians 1:7 and Matthew 26:28.
The problem arises when a story emerges in which God Incarnate himself breaks this rule. In the story of the paralytic, there is no shedding of blood an any of the accounts.</description>

      <title>2025 09 14 the Greatest Need</title>

      <description>The first section emphasizes obtaining help often &amp;ldquo;requires a certain professional&amp;rdquo;.
This story is one of the few that can be found in all four gospel accounts.
Matthew 9:1-8 Mark 2:1-12 Luke 5:17-26 John 5:5-17 An interesting statement is found in Luke 5:17. It states that &amp;ldquo;the Lord&amp;rsquo;s power&amp;rdquo; was &amp;ldquo;in Jesus&amp;rdquo;. That would be quite different than the power originating in Jesus. It implies an anointing similar to Elijah or Moses or the prophets.</description>

      <title>Paralytic sins forgiven with no repentance?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/paralytic-repentence-missing/</link>

      <description>The story of the &amp;ldquo;Healing of the paralytic&amp;rdquo; is found in four places:
Matthew 9:1-8 Mark 2:1-12 Luke 5:17-26 John 5:8-9 Where&amp;rsquo;s repentance?? Nowhere in any of the accounts does the paralyzed man repent of anything. Is repentance optional? Certainly seems important elsewhere:
Matthew 3:2 Matthew 4:17 Mark 1:15 Mark 6:12 Luke 13:3-5 Acts 2:38 In Luke 17:3-4, people are not required to forgive except there&amp;rsquo;s repentance.
Why is there no concern about whether this man had repented or not?</description>

      <description>Ezekiel addressed as Son of Man 63 times The book of Ezekiel is chunked full of examples in which Yehovah addresses him as Son of Man. One example from Ezekiel 2:6-8
And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions.[fn] Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.</description>

      <description>The story of the &amp;ldquo;Healing of the paralytic&amp;rdquo; is found in four places:
Matthew 9:1-8 Mark 2:1-12 Luke 5:17-26 John 5:8-9 Modern application A veteran rolls his wheelchair down the aisle, a small quilt covering the stumps he has remaining for legs. He is led through the plan of salvation.
&amp;ldquo;Are my sins forgiven?&amp;rdquo;, he asks.
&amp;ldquo;Yes, your sins are forgiven.&amp;rdquo;
He looks searchingly. &amp;ldquo;When do you get to the part about taking up my chair and walking?</description>

      <title>Why did Jesus affirm someone afflicted has sin that caused it?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/presumption-sin-causes-affliction/</link>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re afflicted because you sinned! The entire book of Job is on a certain theme. Starting with Job 2:11, Job&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo; come to &amp;ldquo;comfort&amp;rdquo; him. They observe the horror of his afflictions. They all determine in unison that his condition was related to his sin. For forty painful chapters, multiple friends of Job join in, each affirming his affliction was because of some sin they could not identify.
Finally, in Job 42:7-42:9, Yehovah rebukes the friends for this false presumption, and in Job 42:10-17 restores the blessings to Job.</description>
