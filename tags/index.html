      Did the original church have official endorsed writings?
Sadly, the answer by most preachers is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. They will recount that &ldquo;canon of scripture&rdquo; was established much later. However, there was an early document that received endorsement, but often does not get the recognition it deserves. The history of this document exists today in your own bible for anyone who cares to look.
The Council at Jerusalem A meeting took place between Paul and the Jerusalem church in approximately 50 A.

      Great music is not always endorsed by deep pockets. The Youtube platform has allowed some of the best moments in music to be captured and shared. There are several artists that are either earning noteriety or gaining it, not because some hot-shot on Music Row decided it, but because we-the-people loved them. Here are some of my favorites.
Chelsea Constable I&rsquo;m putting Chelsea and Grace at the top of the list because they illustrate what my post is all about.

Sadly, the answer by most preachers is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. They will recount that &ldquo;canon of scripture&rdquo; was established much later. However, there was an early document that received endorsement, but often does not get the recognition it deserves. The history of this document exists today in your own bible for anyone who cares to look.
The Council at Jerusalem A meeting took place between Paul and the Jerusalem church in approximately 50 A.

      I hold it to be self-evident that nobody can do their job as senator or congressman when the bills put before them are thousands of pages long. I think you will all agree with me, this is not just sometimes, this is ALWAYS an effort to hide the evil that&rsquo;s within. I took action by creating a document I&rsquo;m calling the Sanity Declaration. I&rsquo;ve already mailed it to several congressmen and senators asking them to sign it.

      This couple, Matt and Cass are simply exercising their God-given rights, but liberals can&rsquo;t stand it when you&rsquo;re independent of their control and truly free.
Tennessee obviously has too much money at it&rsquo;s disposal. It has started the persecution tactics exercised in tyrannical states like New York or Massachusets. We obviously need fewer government employees to harass people like these who only want to be left alone in their little cabin on their own property.

With commentary from Phil Godlewsky This version has thought-provoking commentary mixed in as it is reviewed. Phil wastes a lot of time in the intro, so I have the link set to begin at the 18:40 mark.
