      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard the &amp;ldquo;Roman Road&amp;rdquo; to salvation as presented by Baptists, Pentecostals and many others, it includes the following as it&amp;rsquo;s first point taken from Romans 3:10.
&amp;hellip; as it is written: â€œNone is righteous, no, not one&amp;quot;;
Now wait, Paul is suggesting he didn&amp;rsquo;t even author this concept. He&amp;rsquo;s describing that it&amp;rsquo;s written, and it&amp;rsquo;s therefore authoritative. So, &amp;ldquo;as it is written&amp;rdquo;, written where? Paul is apparently loosely quoting this from Psalm 14:1-3.</description>

      <title>Which side of the faith-works dispute is inspired?</title>

      <description>Justification. Paul says works have nothing to do with it. Galatians 2:17:
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
James on the other hand disputes this in James 2:14-26:</description>

      <title>Why does Jesus dispute Paul&#39;s &#39;Roman Road&#39; method of salvation?</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard an &amp;ldquo;altar call&amp;rdquo; in a Baptist church, it almost always concludes with Romans 10:9:
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe* in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
The statement is absolute. There&amp;rsquo;s no maybe in the context.
So what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?
Well, the problem is that Jesus disputes it in Matthew 7:21-23.</description>
