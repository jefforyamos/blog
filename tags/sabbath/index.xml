      <description>There is no New Testament commandment to stop keeping the Sabbath, the fourth of the Ten Commandments. There is no commandment to start worshipping instead on Sunday. The alleged reason tends to sound like this:
The followers of Jesus in Jerusalem had communion on Sunday, so we follow their tradition.
Indeed, in Acts 20:6-7, in Paul&amp;rsquo;s visit to Troas, there is a mention of &amp;ldquo;breaking bread&amp;rdquo;. Christianity supposes that since we refer to the Sunday Euchrist or Communion ceremony today by that term today, then by necessity, it must have been called that back then.</description>
