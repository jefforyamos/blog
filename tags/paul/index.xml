      <description>Crisis. Acts 1. Jesus has just departed into the clouds. Former “Apostle” Judas was gone. He had to be replaced. He was required to “have been with us the whole time Jesus was living among us.” (Acts 1:21) Two men were found equally worthy. (Acts 1:23) Could they have both? Nope. The number was restored to exactly twelve (Acts 1:26). Eleven was not okay. Thirteen was not okay. Twelve. Exactly twelve.</description>
