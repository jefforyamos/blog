      <title>Which side of the faith-works dispute is inspired?</title>

      <description>Justification. Paul says works have nothing to do with it. Galatians 2:17:
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
James on the other hand disputes this in James 2:14-26:</description>

      <title>Why does Jesus dispute Paul&#39;s &#39;Roman Road&#39; method of salvation?</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard an &amp;ldquo;altar call&amp;rdquo; in a Baptist church, it almost always concludes with Romans 10:9:
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe* in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
The statement is absolute. There&amp;rsquo;s no maybe in the context.
So what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?
Well, the problem is that Jesus disputes it in Matthew 7:21-23.</description>

      <title>Sinai - out of bondage, or in?</title>

      <description>Bondage. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine a situation in which that word would be anything but dreaded, right? The word itself invokes in us a visceral response similar to words like hunger or loneliness or helplessness. It&amp;rsquo;s not something desirable. It&amp;rsquo;s something to be avoided.
In Exodus 20:2, we find that very word in the first of the &amp;ldquo;Ten Commandments&amp;rdquo;:
I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</description>

      <title>How Many Apostles?</title>

      <description>Crisis. Acts 1. Jesus has just departed into the clouds. Former “Apostle” Judas was gone. He had to be replaced. He was required to “have been with us the whole time Jesus was living among us.” (Acts 1:21) Two men were found equally worthy. (Acts 1:23) Could they have both? Nope. The number was restored to exactly twelve (Acts 1:26). Eleven was not okay. Thirteen was not okay. Twelve. Exactly twelve.</description>

      <title>Why does Paul practice fund-raising?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/why-is-fundraising-okay-for-paul/</link>

      <description>Jesus first sent his twelve Apostles on The Great Commission, this time to Jews only, in Matthew 10:5-10. He prescribed a certain behavior for them to follow. This included a prohibition on fundraising:
You received without paying, give without paying. Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts. While Paul was self-declared as an Apostle likewise, he had different behavior.
He dedicated an entire chapter, Phillippians 4 to the subject of fund raising.</description>

      <title>Was Paul a Fundraiser?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/is-paul-a-fundraiser/</link>

      <description>When it is pointed out that Paul engaged in fundraising activities in Phillippians 4, some respond by saying something like this:
&amp;ldquo;Paul was not accepting a &amp;ldquo;seed money&amp;rdquo; for blessing like the TV preachers. He was just accepting small gifts for his own personal needs. It was not something that could be called &amp;lsquo;fund raising&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;
Paul seemed to be taking up a collection for &amp;ldquo;the poor&amp;rdquo; in Jerusalem as we see in Romans 15:25-26.</description>

      <title>Writings of Paul originally rejected by Jerusalem leadership</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/post/writings_of_paul_were_rejected/</link>

      <description>Did the original church have official endorsed writings?
Sadly, the answer by most preachers is &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;. They will recount that &amp;ldquo;canon of scripture&amp;rdquo; was established much later. However, there was an early document that received endorsement, but often does not get the recognition it deserves. The history of this document exists today in your own bible for anyone who cares to look.
The Council at Jerusalem A meeting took place between Paul and the Jerusalem church in approximately 50 A.</description>
