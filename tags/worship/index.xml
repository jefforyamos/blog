      <description>Who should be worshipped according to the Christian Bible?
In Matthew 2:2-8, people from foreign religions found it appropriate to worship baby Jesus. There is no record of anyone preventing them. In Matthew 4:10, Jesus expressed that God ONLY was to be worshipped because God&amp;rsquo;s laws demanded it. In Matthew 15:7-9, Mark 7:6-7 and Luke 4:7-8 Jesus quoted Isaiah where God demanded worship that is sincere. Jesus tells the woman at the well &amp;ldquo;worship the Father&amp;rdquo; in John 4:22-24.</description>
