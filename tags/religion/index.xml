      <description>These are somewhat random articles I&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;ldquo;put to paper&amp;rdquo; as I think of them. I&amp;rsquo;m human, I don&amp;rsquo;t profess any divine empowerment. These questions are constructed from my own study with a hope of enlightenment my own prayer. I recommend you question everything, and that includes me. (yeah, I know, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the contact page working yet&amp;hellip;sorry).
I&amp;rsquo;m creating these articles as &amp;ldquo;single conversation sized&amp;rdquo; bites. I anticipate this being a collection that grows over time.</description>

      <description>Did the original church have official endorsed writings?
Sadly, the answer by most preachers is &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;. They will recount that &amp;ldquo;canon of scripture&amp;rdquo; was established much later. However, there was an early document that received endorsement, but often does not get the recognition it deserves. The history of this document exists today in your own bible for anyone who cares to look.
The Council at Jerusalem A meeting took place between Paul and the Jerusalem church in approximately 50 A.</description>
