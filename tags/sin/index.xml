      <description>There is a foundational Christian doctrine that is often stated:
Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.
The primary source for the doctrine is Hebrews 9:22.
According to Yehovah, charity and righteousness atone for sin.
Proverbs 10:2 - righteousness delivers from death Proverbs 11:4 - delivers from death Proverbs 16:6 - steadfast love atones for iniquity Proverbs 21:3 - superior to blood sacrifice in His eyes Hosea 6:6 - what he really desires Daniel 4:27 - Lengthens prosperity </description>

      <description>Ezekiel addressed as Son of Man 63 times The book of Ezekiel is chunked full of examples in which Yehovah addresses him as Son of Man. One example from Ezekiel 2:6-8
And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions.[fn] Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.</description>

      <description>The story of the &amp;ldquo;Healing of the paralytic&amp;rdquo; is found in four places:
Matthew 9:1-8 Mark 2:1-12 Luke 5:17-26 John 5:8-9 Modern application A veteran rolls his wheelchair down the aisle, a small quilt covering the stumps he has remaining for legs. He is led through the plan of salvation.
&amp;ldquo;Are my sins forgiven?&amp;rdquo;, he asks.
&amp;ldquo;Yes, your sins are forgiven.&amp;rdquo;
He looks searchingly. &amp;ldquo;When do you get to the part about taking up my chair and walking?</description>

      <title>Why did Jesus affirm someone afflicted has sin that caused it?</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re afflicted because you sinned! The entire book of Job is on a certain theme. Starting with Job 2:11, Job&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo; come to &amp;ldquo;comfort&amp;rdquo; him. They observe the horror of his afflictions. They all determine in unison that his condition was related to his sin. For forty painful chapters, multiple friends of Job join in, each affirming his affliction was because of some sin they could not identify.
Finally, in Job 42:7-42:9, Yehovah rebukes the friends for this false presumption, and in Job 42:10-17 restores the blessings to Job.</description>
