      <description>When the Jerusalem church met to discuss what was required of Gentile believers, they decided on a four-item list as a set of basic requirements for new converts. Acts 15:19-21.

Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.
