      <description>Source text: 2 Corinthians 1:8-10; 2 Corinthians 12:6-10
Overall lesson I agree mostly with the lesson the author attempted here. It is summarized by a quote from Psalm 62:1.
I am at rest in God alone; my salvation comes from him.
As in many cases, the author supposes the psalmist speaking of &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; meant &amp;ldquo;Jesus&amp;rdquo;. So the author hears about someday seeing Jesus, but my only context is someday seeing Yehovah.</description>

      <title>Paralytic sins forgiven with no repentance?</title>

      <description>The story of the &amp;ldquo;Healing of the paralytic&amp;rdquo; is found in four places:
Matthew 9:1-8 Mark 2:1-12 Luke 5:17-26 John 5:8-9 Where&amp;rsquo;s repentance?? Nowhere in any of the accounts does the paralyzed man repent of anything. Is repentance optional? Certainly seems important elsewhere:
Matthew 3:2 Matthew 4:17 Mark 1:15 Mark 6:12 Luke 13:3-5 Acts 2:38 In Luke 17:3-4, people are not required to forgive except there&amp;rsquo;s repentance.
Why is there no concern about whether this man had repented or not?</description>
