      <description>Bondage. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine a situation in which that word would be anything but dreaded, right? The word itself invokes in us a visceral response similar to words like hunger or loneliness or helplessness. It&amp;rsquo;s not something desirable. It&amp;rsquo;s something to be avoided.
In Exodus 20:2, we find that very word in the first of the &amp;ldquo;Ten Commandments&amp;rdquo;:
I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</description>

      <description>In Exodus 31:13, Yehovah declares the following:
Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.
It is further emphasized in Ezekiel 20:12-20.
Christians have fought valiantly to preserve The Ten Commmandments on plaques on courthouses all over the United States.</description>

      <title>Why did Jesus say obey what&#39;s read from Moses&#39; seat?</title>

      <description>In Matthew 23:1-3, Jesus is quoted saying:
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat, so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do&amp;hellip;.
What specifically is read from Moses&amp;rsquo; seat? (hint, think who&amp;rsquo;s buried in Grant&amp;rsquo;s tomb). The law of God as delivered to Moses of course!
Is it possible that Christians think God&amp;rsquo;s law is a burden, and schoolmaster and against us because of something Paul says?</description>
