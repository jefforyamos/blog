      <description>You can eat anything! &amp;ldquo;There are no food restrictions in Christianity. You can eat whatever you want.&amp;rdquo;
Christians often cite the passage in Mark 7:14-18 as proof text that BBQ and catfish should be a mainstay in the diet of Christians. Indeed, in Jesus is quoted in Mark 7:18 that &amp;ldquo;whatsoever thing from without that entereth into the man, it cannot defile him.&amp;rdquo; So is this carte-blanche blessing on eating anything you please?</description>

      <description>Last chapter in the Christian Old Testament: Malachi 4 1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. 2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.</description>

      <title>Which side of the faith-works dispute is inspired?</title>

      <description>Justification. Paul says works have nothing to do with it. Galatians 2:17:
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
James on the other hand disputes this in James 2:14-26:</description>

      <title>Sinai - out of bondage, or in?</title>

      <description>Bondage. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine a situation in which that word would be anything but dreaded, right? The word itself invokes in us a visceral response similar to words like hunger or loneliness or helplessness. It&amp;rsquo;s not something desirable. It&amp;rsquo;s something to be avoided.
In Exodus 20:2, we find that very word in the first of the &amp;ldquo;Ten Commandments&amp;rdquo;:
I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</description>

      <title>Does Christianity really believe in the &#39;Ten Commandments&#39;?</title>

      <description>In Exodus 31:13, Yehovah declares the following:
Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.
It is further emphasized in Ezekiel 20:12-20.
Christians have fought valiantly to preserve The Ten Commmandments on plaques on courthouses all over the United States.</description>

      <title>Why did Jesus say obey what&#39;s read from Moses&#39; seat?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/obey-readings-from-moses-seat/</link>

      <description>In Matthew 23:1-3, Jesus is quoted saying:
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat, so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do&amp;hellip;.
What specifically is read from Moses&amp;rsquo; seat? (hint, think who&amp;rsquo;s buried in Grant&amp;rsquo;s tomb). The law of God as delivered to Moses of course!
Is it possible that Christians think God&amp;rsquo;s law is a burden, and schoolmaster and against us because of something Paul says?</description>
