      <description>In Exodus 31:13, Yehovah declares the following:
Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.
It is further emphasized in Ezekiel 20:12-20.
Christians have fought valiantly to preserve The Ten Commmandments on plaques on courthouses all over the United States.</description>

      <description>In Matthew 23:1-3, Jesus is quoted saying:
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat, so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do&amp;hellip;.
What specifically is read from Moses&amp;rsquo; seat? (hint, think who&amp;rsquo;s buried in Grant&amp;rsquo;s tomb). The law of God as delivered to Moses of course!
Is it possible that Christians think God&amp;rsquo;s law is a burden, and schoolmaster and against us because of something Paul says?</description>
