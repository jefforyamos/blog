      <title>Paralytic story - Where Is Shed Blood?</title>

      <description>There is a doctrine that is often stated:
Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.
Though the primary source is Hebrews 9:22, secondary sources for the doctrine would be Ephesians 1:7 and Matthew 26:28.
The problem arises when a story emerges in which God Incarnate himself breaks this rule. In the story of the paralytic, there is no shedding of blood an any of the accounts.</description>

      <description>The first section emphasizes obtaining help often &amp;ldquo;requires a certain professional&amp;rdquo;.
This story is one of the few that can be found in all four gospel accounts.
Matthew 9:1-8 Mark 2:1-12 Luke 5:17-26 John 5:5-17 An interesting statement is found in Luke 5:17. It states that &amp;ldquo;the Lord&amp;rsquo;s power&amp;rdquo; was &amp;ldquo;in Jesus&amp;rdquo;. That would be quite different than the power originating in Jesus. It implies an anointing similar to Elijah or Moses or the prophets.</description>

      <title>Paralytic sins forgiven with no repentance?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/paralytic-repentence-missing/</link>

      <description>The story of the &amp;ldquo;Healing of the paralytic&amp;rdquo; is found in four places:
Matthew 9:1-8 Mark 2:1-12 Luke 5:17-26 John 5:8-9 Where&amp;rsquo;s repentance?? Nowhere in any of the accounts does the paralyzed man repent of anything. Is repentance optional? Certainly seems important elsewhere:
Matthew 3:2 Matthew 4:17 Mark 1:15 Mark 6:12 Luke 13:3-5 Acts 2:38 In Luke 17:3-4, people are not required to forgive except there&amp;rsquo;s repentance.
Why is there no concern about whether this man had repented or not?</description>
