      <description>In John 17, a prayer is recorded in which Jesus seems to pray a priestly style blessing upon his twelve apostles. This is the last act of Jesus prior to his arrest according to this gospel account. It seems as if Jesus is praying a special anointing upon them.
The prayer includes several interesting things:
John 17:6-10 They were given to him by God, apparently meaning God selected them. Jesus manifested the name of God (Yehovah) to them.</description>

      <description>Crisis. Acts 1. Jesus has just departed into the clouds. Former “Apostle” Judas was gone. He had to be replaced. He was required to “have been with us the whole time Jesus was living among us.” (Acts 1:21) Two men were found equally worthy. (Acts 1:23) Could they have both? Nope. The number was restored to exactly twelve (Acts 1:26). Eleven was not okay. Thirteen was not okay. Twelve. Exactly twelve.</description>
