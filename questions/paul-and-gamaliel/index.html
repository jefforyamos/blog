    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>During his trial in Jerusalem in Acts 22, Paul of Tarsus makes an interesting claim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, <strong>educated at the feet of Gamaliel</strong> according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day. I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women, as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, so Paul was lock-step with Gamaliel, huh?  This Gamaliel guy wanted everybody that followed Jesus dead, to hear Paul tell it. I guess it makes his actions pretty much <em>their fault</em> then, right?</p>
<p>But was this the truth?  No, not at all. In truth, Paul and Gamaliel were deeply divided.</p>
<p>In Acts 5:17-42, we find the <strong>cancel culture</strong> of that day was trying to destroy the Jesus movement. But who rose up as their protector?  The very guy Paul claims to be so tightly knit with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But a <strong>Pharisee</strong> in the council <strong>named Gamaliel</strong>, a <strong>teacher of the law held in honor</strong> by all the people, stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while.
And he said to them, “Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men.
For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.
After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered.
So in the present case I tell you, <strong>keep away from these men and let them alone</strong>, for <strong>if</strong> this plan or this undertaking is <strong>of man, it will fail</strong>;
but <strong>if</strong> it is <strong>of God, you will not be able to overthrow them</strong>. You might even be found opposing God!” So <strong>they took his advice</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Took his advice? His followers? No, his contemporaries in the priesthood. Acts 5:17. Here we find <em>people who did not study at his feet</em> and reverence his wisdom taking his advice. There is no record of anyone resisting him.</p>
<p>But who is the <strong>one guy</strong> that <strong>does exactly the opposite</strong> of what he proposes, and what the council consents to?  The lawless rebel Paul.  They same arrogant guy that <a href="./../paul-did-not-learn-from-apostles">took delight in not learning anything from the apostles</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, Gamaliel says we should keep God&rsquo;s law, Paul says we should ditch it. Gamaliel says the Jesus movement should be left alone, Paul says they should be murdered.</p>
<p>In <em>exactly what way</em> do we find Paul to be some student of Gamaliel?</p>
<div style="font-size:larger;font-weight: bolder;">
        🙋❓Why is Paul esteemed a worthy student of Gamalial when everything Paul did AS his student was seemingly an effort to undermine Gamaliel&#39;s wishes?</div><ul class="pa0">
