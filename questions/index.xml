      <description>In Exodus 31:13, Yehovah declares the following:
Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.
It is further emphasized in Ezekiel 20:12-20.
Christians have fought valiantly to preserve The Ten Commmandments on plaques on courthouses all over the United States.</description>

      <title>Why does Christianity have an inexplicable compulsion to ignore the Sabbaths?</title>

It&amp;rsquo;s easy to demonstrate both Jesus and the early church observed Sabbaths both before and after his ascension:</description>

      <title>Why is atonement by righteousness and charity ignored?</title>

      <description>There is a foundational Christian doctrine that is often stated:
Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.
The primary source for the doctrine is Hebrews 9:22.
According to Yehovah, charity and righteousness atone for sin.
Proverbs 10:2 - righteousness delivers from death Proverbs 11:4 - delivers from death Proverbs 16:6 - steadfast love atones for iniquity Proverbs 21:3 - superior to blood sacrifice in His eyes Hosea 6:6 - what he really desires Daniel 4:27 - Lengthens prosperity </description>

      <title>Paralytic story - Where Is Shed Blood?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/paralytic-where-is-shed-blood/</link>

      <description>There is a doctrine that is often stated:
Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.
Though the primary source is Hebrews 9:22, secondary sources for the doctrine would be Ephesians 1:7 and Matthew 26:28.
The problem arises when a story emerges in which God Incarnate himself breaks this rule. In the story of the paralytic, there is no shedding of blood an any of the accounts.</description>

      <title>Why did Jesus say obey what&#39;s read from Moses&#39; seat?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/obey-readings-from-moses-seat/</link>

      <description>In Matthew 23:1-3, Jesus is quoted saying:
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat, so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do&amp;hellip;.
What specifically is read from Moses&amp;rsquo; seat? (hint, think who&amp;rsquo;s buried in Grant&amp;rsquo;s tomb). The law of God as delivered to Moses of course!
Is it possible that Christians think God&amp;rsquo;s law is a burden, and schoolmaster and against us because of something Paul says?</description>

      <title>Paralytic sins forgiven with no repentance?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/paralytic-repentence-missing/</link>

      <description>The story of the &amp;ldquo;Healing of the paralytic&amp;rdquo; is found in four places:
Matthew 9:1-8 Mark 2:1-12 Luke 5:17-26 John 5:8-9 Where&amp;rsquo;s repentance?? Nowhere in any of the accounts does the paralyzed man repent of anything. Is repentance optional? Certainly seems important elsewhere:
Matthew 3:2 Matthew 4:17 Mark 1:15 Mark 6:12 Luke 13:3-5 Acts 2:38 In Luke 17:3-4, people are not required to forgive except there&amp;rsquo;s repentance.
Why is there no concern about whether this man had repented or not?</description>

      <title>Could Ezekiel Forgive Sin?</title>

      <description>Ezekiel addressed as Son of Man 63 times The book of Ezekiel is chunked full of examples in which Yehovah addresses him as Son of Man. One example from Ezekiel 2:6-8
And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions.[fn] Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.</description>

      <title>Who decides expiration dates on New Testament promises?</title>

      <description>There is a pretty amazing promise made in Mark 16:17-20:
And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover. So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</description>

Matthew 9:1-8 Mark 2:1-12 Luke 5:17-26 John 5:8-9 Modern application A veteran rolls his wheelchair down the aisle, a small quilt covering the stumps he has remaining for legs. He is led through the plan of salvation.
&amp;ldquo;Are my sins forgiven?&amp;rdquo;, he asks.
&amp;ldquo;Yes, your sins are forgiven.&amp;rdquo;
He looks searchingly. &amp;ldquo;When do you get to the part about taking up my chair and walking?</description>

      <title>Why did Jesus affirm someone afflicted has sin that caused it?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/presumption-sin-causes-affliction/</link>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re afflicted because you sinned! The entire book of Job is on a certain theme. Starting with Job 2:11, Job&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo; come to &amp;ldquo;comfort&amp;rdquo; him. They observe the horror of his afflictions. They all determine in unison that his condition was related to his sin. For forty painful chapters, multiple friends of Job join in, each affirming his affliction was because of some sin they could not identify.
Finally, in Job 42:7-42:9, Yehovah rebukes the friends for this false presumption, and in Job 42:10-17 restores the blessings to Job.</description>

      <title>How Many Apostles?</title>

      <description>Crisis. Acts 1. Jesus has just departed into the clouds. Former “Apostle” Judas was gone. He had to be replaced. He was required to “have been with us the whole time Jesus was living among us.” (Acts 1:21) Two men were found equally worthy. (Acts 1:23) Could they have both? Nope. The number was restored to exactly twelve (Acts 1:26). Eleven was not okay. Thirteen was not okay. Twelve. Exactly twelve.</description>

      <title>Did False Witnesses Against Stephen Lie?</title>

      <description>In the early days of the Jerusalem church, the Pharisees cornered a follower of Jesus named Stephen. The entirety of the story is found in Acts 6. The religious leaders &amp;ldquo;could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking&amp;rdquo;. They sought to trap him another way:
And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.</description>

      <description>These are somewhat random articles I&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;ldquo;put to paper&amp;rdquo; as I think of them. I&amp;rsquo;m human, I don&amp;rsquo;t profess any divine empowerment. These questions are constructed from my own study with a hope of enlightenment my own prayer. I recommend you question everything, and that includes me. (yeah, I know, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the contact page working yet&amp;hellip;sorry).
I&amp;rsquo;m creating these articles as &amp;ldquo;single conversation sized&amp;rdquo; bites. I anticipate this being a collection that grows over time.</description>

      <title>Why does Paul practice fund-raising?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/why-is-fundraising-okay-for-paul/</link>

      <description>Jesus first sent his twelve Apostles on The Great Commission, this time to Jews only, in Matthew 10:5-10. He prescribed a certain behavior for them to follow. This included a prohibition on fundraising:
You received without paying, give without paying. Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts. While Paul was self-declared as an Apostle likewise, he had different behavior.
He dedicated an entire chapter, Phillippians 4 to the subject of fund raising.</description>

      <title>Was Paul a Fundraiser?</title>
      <link>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/is-paul-a-fundraiser/</link>

      <guid>https://jefforyamos.github.io/blog/questions/is-paul-a-fundraiser/</guid>
      <description>When it is pointed out that Paul engaged in fundraising activities in Phillippians 4, some respond by saying something like this:
&amp;ldquo;Paul was not accepting a &amp;ldquo;seed money&amp;rdquo; for blessing like the TV preachers. He was just accepting small gifts for his own personal needs. It was not something that could be called &amp;lsquo;fund raising&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;
Paul seemed to be taking up a collection for &amp;ldquo;the poor&amp;rdquo; in Jerusalem as we see in Romans 15:25-26.</description>
