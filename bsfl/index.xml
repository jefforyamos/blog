      <description>The first section emphasizes obtaining help often &amp;ldquo;requires a certain professional&amp;rdquo;.
This story is one of the few that can be found in all four gospel accounts.
Matthew 9:1-8 Mark 2:1-12 Luke 5:17-26 John 5:5-17 An interesting statement is found in Luke 5:17. It states that &amp;ldquo;the Lord&amp;rsquo;s power&amp;rdquo; was &amp;ldquo;in Jesus&amp;rdquo;. That would be quite different than the power originating in Jesus. It implies an anointing similar to Elijah or Moses or the prophets.</description>

      <description>The opening section does a good job introducing generosity using the example of Warren Buffet, who is said to give 99% of his income away. However, it&amp;rsquo;s pointed out he is an agnostic and generosity is a &amp;ldquo;heart issue&amp;rdquo;, I suppose implying he is lacking the right heart. It concludes by identifying the target.
In our study, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how God&amp;rsquo;s abundant grace moves us toward a generous lifestyle.
Well, that sounds good.</description>
