<h3 id="overall-lesson">Overall lesson</h3>
<p>I agree mostly with the lesson the author attempted here. It is summarized by a quote from Psalm 62:1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am at rest in God alone; my salvation comes from him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in many cases, the author supposes the psalmist speaking of &ldquo;God&rdquo; meant &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo;. So the author hears about someday seeing Jesus, but my only context is someday seeing Yehovah.  Nevertheless, I mostly agree with the thrust of the lesson, and fully applaud the celebration of how God brings us through struggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That DUI was the best thing that ever happened to me.&rdquo; Yes, an excellent example of how Yehovah works in a person&rsquo;s life through apparent adversity.</p>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>
<p>An added bonus to me personally were the asides in which the author reveals what this means in his live personally as one confronted with physical blindness. I can fully appreciate how the promises of God would take on a whole new dimension with him. It&rsquo;s one thing to learn about war from someone who&rsquo;s read about war, but this author has metaphorically experienced the war he speaks of. The sincerity of the author shines.</p>
<h3 id="the-underlying-text-of-the-lesson">The underlying text of the lesson</h3>
<p>If I were writing about this very valid lesson, I would have used perhaps Joseph in prison in Egypt as the underlying example, or Elijah crying out in the cave he&rsquo;s the only one. Maybe Noah being ridiculed and persecuted by society as he builds a big ship inland from the sea. These men all faced despair and God led them through it.</p>
<p>This precious author makes a presumption about Paul that I believe is fatally flawed. It is presumed that Paul is persecuted wrongfully. If I were entitling a lesson for this text, I would call it, &ldquo;That which you sow you shall also reap&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="recognitions-by-the-author-that-i-applaud">Recognitions by the author that I applaud</h3>
<p>Before I talk about things I disagree with, let me applaud a few things. In the aside on page 31, the author recognizes several things that are absolutely correct:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;boasting is a major theme&rdquo; in 2nd Corinthians.</li>
<li>He is &ldquo;responding to critics&rdquo; that have accused him of boasting.</li>
<li>Paul does emphasize his suffering.</li>
<li>Paul extols the virtue of suffering and implies it is a mark of fidelity.</li>
<li>Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;critics apparently claimed unusual spiritual experience and powers&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though I agree with the observations above, I disagree on the appropriate appropriate conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="we-dont-know-or-we-dont-want-to-know">We don&rsquo;t know, or we don&rsquo;t WANT to know?</h3>
<p>At the bottom of page 26, column 1, we find the following assertion by the author:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although <strong>we don&rsquo;t know exactly what troubles Paul was referencing</strong> in these verses, there was enough to go around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe we know exactly <em>what &ldquo;troubles&rdquo;</em> Paul is referencing. Paul was accused of falsely calling himself an &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; to those at Ephesus and put on trial. Oh, we don&rsquo;t <strong>LIKE</strong> this conclusion, but we do <strong>KNOW</strong> if we&rsquo;re willing to look and get past our traditions about the divinity of post-conversion Paul. The evidence is abundant, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>This author hints at it when he mentions the &ldquo;Jews&hellip;knipping at his heels&rdquo;. Paul lashes out in Galatians 2:12 at those &ldquo;of the circumcision&rdquo; who were send &ldquo;from James&rdquo;. James was the brother of Jesus and the leader of the Jerusalem Jesus movement.</li>
<li>Paul openly claimed to be an &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; to this very church in Ephesus. Ephesus was the <a href="https://share.google/aimode/l2HDf6JIxVxCYHBva">most prominent city in Asia</a>.</li>
<li>Paul&rsquo;s claim of apostleship stood challenged as he himself noted in 1 Corinthians 9:1-3.
<ul>
<li>He was accused of lying</li>
<li>The lie related to his claim of apostleship</li>
<li>He mentions those who &ldquo;examine me&rdquo; as if he was formally tried.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revelation 2:1-2 praises those in Ephesus for this saying they were in danger of losing their &ldquo;candlestick&rdquo; in Revelation 2:3-5 because they had fallen prey.</li>
<li>Paul whines again in 1 Timothy 2:7 that he is called a liar for claiming to be an apostle.</li>
<li>Paul mentions being tried in 2 Timothy 4:16, just like Revelation 2:2 says.</li>
<li>Paul himself says those that &ldquo;turned away from me&rdquo; include &ldquo;all they which are in Asia&rdquo;. 2 Timothy 1:15. How many is &ldquo;all&rdquo;? Apparently not Timothy, but certainly the majority.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-pauls-example-really-teaches-us">What Paul&rsquo;s example <em>really</em> teaches us</h3>
<p>I conclude my assertion that <strong>we absolutely know</strong> what troubled Paul. Because Paul was <strong>accurately accused</strong> and was unrepentant, this story represents a polar opposite to what we should be learning today. Paul was not enduring persecution for doing the right thing, he was being punished for doing the wrong thing. Like <a href="https://share.google/aimode/OR0wn8DqniuA9KBoy">every sociopath</a> before him or after him, he was unrepentant and considered it the fault of someone else, not him.  His life <em>did not pass the smell test</em>.  His mistakes were <em>like a smell you can&rsquo;t escape</em>. He was like the DUI driver except he blames the cop for pulling him over, or blames his bartender for letting him drink. He as anti-matter to the lesson at hand.</p>
<p>Like every sociopath, he had a <a href="https://share.google/aimode/lTbpoDArZqMrd0L0f">grandiose over-inflated view of himself</a>.</p>
<p>The author tells us on the aside on page 31:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What may have surprised his readers was his emphasis on his suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, not surprised at all. Again, <a href="https://share.google/aimode/Cx67R6HXaPEIAa6V0">playing the victim is expected</a>.</p>
<p>He is not at all the first sociopath to <a href="https://share.google/aimode/bgTCICxntDmH35UVb">consider himself infallible</a>. But unlike most, his followers also consider him infallible.</p>
<h3 id="a-strong-clue-you-missed">A strong clue you missed</h3>
<p>As we know, <a href="https://share.google/aimode/6Cl853qY7h09y6I5Y">sociopaths exalt themselves</a> and can&rsquo;t seem to control it. Within your lesson text in 2 Corinthians 12:6-8, we see this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul acknowledges a personal problem with boasting.</li>
<li>God had to punish him in an effort to make him stop.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;thorn&rdquo; was a &ldquo;messenger&rdquo;. A messenger delivers&hellip;.what&hellip;messages.</li>
<li>The messenger according to Paul was &ldquo;from Satan&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>How common is this really? How many people do you know that had such a bad problem with bragging that God had to send a demon to make him stop? Paul was obviously on the chart on this measure of sociopathy.</p>
<h3 id="the-tragedy">The tragedy</h3>
<p>My heart sank when I read this line from the aside on page 31 speaking of 2 Corinthians 12:2 :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;many agree the story of being caught up into the third heaven is autobiographical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh my goodness. Does this precious author also think this? Such a tragedy how the priesthood exalts Paul to near divinity while Paul speaks such evil of Yehovah and his commandments. You already think Jesus was &ldquo;God in the flesh&rdquo;. If you have the teachings of Jesus, what in the world are you doing letting a madman like Paul define your means of salvation??? So tragic. Of all the people I would want to <em>see</em> truths that others miss, this author would be foremost in my heart.</p>
