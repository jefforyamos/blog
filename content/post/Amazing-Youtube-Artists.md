Great music is not always endorsed by deep pockets.  The Youtube platform has allowed some of the best moments in music to be captured and shared. There are several artists that are either earning noteriety or gaining it, not because some hot-shot on Music Row decided it, but because we-the-people loved them.  Here are some of my favorites.

## Chelsea Constable

I'm putting [Chelsea and Grace](https://www.youtube.com/@ChelseaConstableGuitar/featured) at the top of the list because they illustrate what my post is all about.  Here are two unlikely looking sisters that really shine.  They are not here to win a beauty pageant.  They are here to entertain in a home style sort of way.  They start off a little slow since one sister is a little better than the other, but toward the end, they really crank out the solos.

## Josh Turner Guitar 

This [artist](https://www.youtube.com/@JoshTurnerGuitar) is one of the most amazing musicians I have ever heard.  I especially love the way he assembles in the most unlikely of places to record with friends.  They are excited about their art and the excitement comes across in their music.

## The Bygones

This is a team comprised of the previously mentioned [Josh Turner](https://www.youtube.com/@JoshTurnerGuitar) and Nashville's own [Allison Young](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyVttxb4-zHo62CB4lwvMXg). They work together well.  Allison supplements the act with a very tasteful fashion of days of past.  I love this duo because they do songs most others would not do.  They ad-lib the instruments and sound effects they lack, and not only does it work for them, it is a sheer delight.

## Mike Massé

In addition to being a great musician, [Mike Massé](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEVZNpzM9oDegvplv5Z36Sw) surrounds himself with other inspiring musicians. I find him to have an amazing voice and delivery.  Again, I love the settings in which he records, with friends in the local pizza restaurant.

## Milk and Blues

This [group](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTSWdQnWren8-8x7t57EB_w) is from Brazil.  They look college age, but they have managed to pull together some nice talent and put a nice spin on familiar songs.

## Colt Clark and Family

Wow, what a delight this family is. I think every musician out there will agree that [Colt Clark](https://www.youtube.com/@TheClarkFamilyCreative) has raised his family right!  I've watched them for several years and I'm amazed just how good they've gotten. Always fun to watch, especially our little sweetie out front.

## Mona Lisa Twins

Okay, I'm going to say it because I think John Lennon would if I didn't.  [These talented ladies](https://www.youtube.com/@MonaLisaTwins) sometimes do Beatles better than the Beatles did.  They are [real-life twins](https://monalisa-twins.com/biography/) from Austria. They have harmonies that blend so nicely, and they play a wide variety of instruments.

## Butterfly Rose

I'm shamelessly plugging this duo which includes my lovely wife Carol, but they really are awesome.  [Carol and Kaye](https://www.youtube.com/@ButterflyRoseCK) teamed up on several productions producing an Americana sort of style that crosses multiple genre.  This is a humorous video that was produced by Kaye's husband Wes.  I think the message of this song echos a familiar feeling for lots of people the crazier the world gets.

## Foxes and Fossils

Being a mixture of old seasoned musicians and young ladies singing, I love the name [Foxes and Fossils](). Personally, I like their version of this song better than the original Beach Boys version.  It's fun seeing the older generation and the youngsters getting together on this.  One interesting note.  Did you think this was a love song?  Well, it is...sort-of.  Listen to the lyrics.  He's about to have a race and he's speaking to his beloved, his car.

## Larissa Liveir

Okay, there's lots of beautiful ladies out there doing cute things, but how many of them are demonstrating true talent?  [Larissa](https://www.youtube.com/@LarissaLiveir) plays guitar better than I ever dreamed of playing, and I love that little smile you get from her every now and then.

{{< youtube DAXKvroYnpA >}}

## The Darzis

Wow, how are they both so good?  [Amir Darzi and Lital Regev](https://www.youtube.com/@Thedarzis) totally belong together.  I can't take my eyes off of them.

{{< youtube mjGjh3ARmkg >}}

## Yoni Schlesinger

*How do you play that and sing at the same time???*  [Yoni](https://www.youtube.com/@mishloa) is a great guitarist and singer in his own rite, but he's even more awesome when he teams up with the Darzis. I find it amazing these musicians are able to play a very complex song while doing very challenging vocals as well.

## The Hindley Street Country Club

This [band](https://www.youtube.com/@theHindleyStreetCountryClub) from South Australia do a nice Eric Clapton cover as well as many others.

{{< youtube vTHcJkPUJVk >}}

## The Main Sequeeze

This [band](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Wu8k-3Yc6tro6KYmLZRvQ) from Los Angeles has a lot of good chemistry. They deliver well on this iconic song.

# A few professionals that rose up through Youtube....

The remainder are not really amateurs any more, but Youtube seems to have been pivotal to their rise to stardom.

## Hauser

I love strings. I love music played with passion.  This guy we only know as [HAUSER](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC09GemGjss3hPdljwtJ8TPA) always has material that moves me emotionally.

{{< youtube lko-lP4FXQs >}}

## Postmodern Jukebox

It's a little of a stretch to call them amateurs.  [Postmodern Jukebox](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCORIeT1hk6tYBuntEXsguLg) are now doing world tours, but they did seem to make their initial emergence on Youtube.  Certainly [Meghan Trainor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk) had the right response to body-shaming when she wrote this song, but this group in my opinion advanced it *the rest of the way* to where it should be. They have an amazing way of making recent songs sound vintage.  Don't miss the bass solo in the middle!
