This couple, [Matt and Cass](https://www.youtube.com/@RunawayMattCass) are simply exercising their God-given rights, but liberals can't stand it when you're independent of their control and truly free.

Tennessee obviously has too much money at it's disposal. It has started the persecution tactics exercised in tyrannical states like New York or Massachusets.  We obviously need fewer government employees to harass people like these who only want to be left alone in their little cabin on their own property.  We need to impel state legislators to leave these people alone.
