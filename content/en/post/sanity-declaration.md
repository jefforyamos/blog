I hold it to be self-evident that nobody can do their job as senator or congressman when the bills put before them are thousands of pages long.
I think you will all agree with me, this is not just sometimes, this is ALWAYS an effort to hide the evil that's within.
I took action by creating a document I'm calling the **Sanity Declaration**.  I've already mailed it to several congressmen and senators asking them to sign it.

Would you help me?  Would you help me blitz them with requests to sign this? Please read it, decide if you agree in principle with it, and if you do, please assist in this effort.

You can view the document by [clicking here](../images/Sanity%20Declaration.pdf).  You may then fill-in the blank with your congressman or senator and either print it, or do a *save-as* to a file and email it.

Reasons I think this approach will work:

- This is a very reasonable thing to ask.
- The origins of this are grass-roots America, you and me.
- Sanity, who is going to be against a "Sanity Declaration"?  Somebody insane, that's who.
- Opposition would require someone to proclaim the Constitution of the USA as inadequate.
- It sends an unmistakable message to a rogue or compromised house leader.
- It is very hard to logically dispute. Opponents will have to resort to mud-slinging and that will be recognized.  

Suggestions

- Handwritten envelopes / letters get more attention.
- A simple plea from you might be something they would find compelling.
- It is assumed in general that for every one person that bothers to write, there are 100x others that feel the same way.
- Liberals will hate this. They will know it's a serious threat should it get attention. Remember they work for you.  They only exist another term if YOU reelect them. Use stronger wording where appropriate.
