This is a blog I have created to throw a few thoughts out there and also to experiment with a few technology tools:

- Created with [Hugo](https://hugo.io).
- Saved on [Github](https://github.com/jefforyamos/blog)
- Publishes changes upon check-in to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- Publish kicked-off at check-in via [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
- Uses the [Ananke theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/gohugo-theme-ananke/).
- Added custom support for highlighting bible references from [Blue Letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org).
- Added ability to render [Mermaid Diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org).
