### The context backdrop

Every lesson has to have a starting place. Every lesson could be criticized for not providing enough context. This lesson is no exception. I will only bring in the context of what is being discussed earlier in the chapter in 1 John 3:1-20.

> See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.

- The Father, not the son, granted our people-group the title "sons of God".  
- Our people-group is enduring rejection and this letter is a reaction to that rejection.
- The reason for the rejection is because its critics "know him not", and therefore, rejection is expected.
- The **HIM** they do not know is "the Father", not Jesus.

> Beloved, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.

- This is the appearance of God, not Jesus. The context is still "the Father" from v.1.
- They don't know what their physical form will be like...
- ...however, they believe it will resemble the form of God because they have the ability to "see him as he is".

> And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.

- This hope inspires our people-group to become *pure* like God now as much as possible.
- This requires effort. "every man...purifieth himself". 
- This purification does not happen as a result of someone else's efforts.
- This purification doesn't just fall out of the sky on them because of our people-group affiliation.

> Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.

- KJV says, "sin IS a transgression of the law".
- Writer doesn't specify which law (Roman law, Torah, Law of Christ) he speaks of.
- Several old testament verses connect "sin" to a violation of Torah law with no mention of any secular law or one declared by the future messiah.
  - Israel's "sin" was a violation of *Torah* law in 2 Kings 10:31, not some secular one.
  - The identity to Torah law and no other is declared "sin" in 2 Kings 14:6.
- Even Paul connected "sin" to Torah alone in Romans 3:20 and Romans 5:13.
- Evidence suggests this people-group spoke of Torah law, and nothing in the text suggests otherwise.
- This people-group advocated obedience to Torah.

> You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.

- Two possible interpretations:
  1. Jesus living sinless excused his believers from the consequences of their disobedience.
  2. Jesus set an example that causes others to seek righteousness as he did.

- To be "in him" seems to mean "abiding in him" as evidenced by the next verse.

> No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.

- Membership in this people-group requires absolute abstinence from sin.  
- To this people-group, to be dismissive of violation of Torah was abhorrent.
- This people-group claims those who are complacent of violations of Torah have "never seen him or know him".

> Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.

- Righteousness to them was something you *practice*, not something you inherit as a gift.
- They took personal responsibility for their own righteous behavior.
- They considered teaching against this as being intentional deception.

> Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.

- They didn't say, "oh well, it's covered under the blood."

> No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God’s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.

- "Born of God" rather than "born again by Jesus" as modern Christianity would call it.
