It may surprise some that a Karaite Jew sort of guy like me would attend Sunday School. It's pretty lonely given the only Karaite Synagogue I know of is on the West Coast. I stumbled in on impulse one day to a small church, and I found some wonderful people there who were willing to tolerate a person with a different point of view, and a lot of startling questions. Shout out to the wonderful people in my class.

This section contains my own notes corresponding to my Sunday School quarterly.  It is published by Lifeway as [Bible Studies for Life: Senior Adults Personal Study Guide](https://www.lifeway.com/en/product/bible-studies-for-life-adult-personal-study-guide-csb-summer-2025-M00101336/005562227.2025-SUM).  Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to follow these notes unless you also reference the book.
