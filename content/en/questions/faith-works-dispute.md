Justification. Paul says works have nothing to do with it. Galatians 2:17:

> Knowing that a man is **not justified** by the **works** of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for **by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified**.

James on the other hand disputes this in James 2:14-26:

- James disputes Paul's claim that one is 'justified by faith' in James 2:24.
- James calls Paul a 'vain man' in James 2:20.
- James disputes Paul's "no flesh justified" claim using Abraham as an example in James 2:20-21.
- James concludes with a single sentence wrecking ball to Paul's 'faith alone' argument in James 2:26.

Amazingly, Christian ministers tend to proclaim that Paul and James were in agreement.
