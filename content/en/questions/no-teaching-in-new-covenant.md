description: "The 'New Covenant' of Christianity doesn't fit the requirements specified in Jeremiah. Christianity's version requires vicarious atonement, a change in the law, continuing education, and evangelizing, all of which Jeremiah says are NOT appropriate. How can Christianity flippantly excuse itself from the prophetic requirements?"

The New Covenant is declared in Jeremiah 31:27-40.  According to Christianity, it was [fulfilled](https://soh.church/what-is-the-new-covenant/) entirely by Jesus.

There are a couple of problems with this assertion. 

- According to Jeremiah 31:30, the righteous don't die on behalf of the wicked. 
- Jeremiah 31:34 describes how educating others about God and evangelizing will no longer be necessary. 

Therefore, the following things suggest very strongly that Christianity is not a fulfillment of this covenant:

- Christianity insists that righteous Jesus died on behalf of sinners which violates Jer 31:30.
- The "Great Commission" prescribes evangelizing that will not be necessary in the new covenant according to Jer 31:34.
- The existence of Sunday School suggests teaching about God is still deemed necessary, thus missing what is also described in Jer 31:34.
- Though the "old covenant" was indeed declared broken in Jeremiah 31:32, there is no mention of a replacement of God's laws.  A covenant is an agreement. There is no hint that "my law" declared in Jer 31:33 is a replacement law. It suggests only the same law with a more effective deployment.
