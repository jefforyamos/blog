There is a foundational Christian doctrine that is often stated:

> Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.

The primary source for the doctrine is Hebrews 9:22.

According to Yehovah, charity and righteousness atone for sin.

- Proverbs 10:2 - righteousness delivers from death
- Proverbs 11:4 - delivers from death
- Proverbs 16:6 - steadfast love **atones** for iniquity
- Proverbs 21:3 - superior to blood sacrifice in His eyes
- Hosea 6:6 - what he really desires
- Daniel 4:27 - Lengthens prosperity
