Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:1-11 delivers a startling revelation:

> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ **died for our sins** in **accordance with the Scriptures**, that he was **buried**, that he was **raised** on the **third day** in accordance with the Scriptures

Naturally, there were no *New Testaments* floating around in those days since Paul's epistles were first fragments to emerge. This would have to be one of those prophecies the Jews were so stupid for not reading, right?  I mean, how could they miss it when the referenced prophecy reveals all this:

- The Messiah would die for people's sins.
- He would be buried.
- He would be raised on the third day.

With a profile like that in the *Old Testament*, even a dumb old Pharisee should be able to spot that one, right?  

But here's the problem. It doesn't exist. You might piece together such a doctrine using obscure phrases scattered about. But I can't find it as a cohesive claim in scripture where the context is about the coming Messiah.

So it leads to an unfortunate question....
