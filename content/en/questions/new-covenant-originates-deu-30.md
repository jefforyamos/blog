description: "Christianity loves to tie its own 'new covenant' back to Jeremiah 31, but will almost never tie it back to where it originated, in Deuteronomy 30. Why? Could it be because it doesn't fit modern Christian doctrine?"

Christianity is eager to tie their claim to the "New Covenant" back to Jeremiah 31:31 in spite of [some problems](./../no-teaching-in-new-covenant).  However, the unmistakable link between Jeremiah 31:33 and Deuteronomy 30:6, both referring to the deployment of the law being written on their hearts....well, that is something they don't really want to talk about.

Why? 

Well, I can think of a reason or two...

- The Deuteronomy text depicts the original Torah returning to the hearts and minds of people in Deu 30:1, and Christianity is deeply invested in a divestment in the "old law".
- It describes a repentance and a return to the law, not some new law, the one that was given to Moses, "all I command you today". Deu 30:2 Unlike Jeremiah, there's no wiggle room here to substitute some "law of Christ" invented by Paul. The bait-and-switch that supposes a new covenant imposes a new law doesn't work in this passage.
- It specifies to hear and obey the voice of Yehovah, not Paul's "my gospel", not even Jesus. Deu 30:2.
- It results in "mercy on you" without any shedding of blood to the great dismay of Christianity. Deu 30:3.
- It provides foundation for distinction between the "shepherds" that "gather" or "scatter" characterized in Ezekiel 34 and elsewhere, and some pretty scary consequences for those that trample God's plan on regathering.
- It says **the Law is not too hard to follow**, while Christianity claims it's impossible to follow. Deu 30:11-14.
- It says we **have a choice** and are not predisposed by Adam and Eve's mistake as the *original sin doctrine* insists. Deu 30:15. Deu 30:19-20.
- It makes it clear it was intended to bless you, not curse you as Christianity claims. Deu 30:6-10. Deu 30:16. Deu 30:19.
- Repentance and return to Torah **precedes** the application of the New Covenant. Deu 30:1-2, Deu 30:6.

Notice how Malachi 4:4 ALSO says you'll see a return to Torah in the "days of Elijah" and before the "day of the Lord".
