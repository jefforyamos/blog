The story of the "Healing of the paralytic" is found in four places:

- Matthew 9:1-8
- Mark 2:1-12
- Luke 5:17-26
- John 5:8-9

### Modern application

A veteran rolls his wheelchair down the aisle, a small quilt covering the stumps he has remaining for legs. He is led through the *plan of salvation*.  

"Are my sins forgiven?", he asks.  

"Yes, your sins are forgiven."  

He looks searchingly.  "When do you get to the part about taking up my chair and walking?"

According to Mark 16:17-18, "those who believe" *should* be able to accommodate this poor guy. I'm quite sure anyone who could fix his situation would be thrilled and willing to do so.

Many will explain this part "expired" with the passing of the last apostle. However, the [Expiration Theory creates more questions than it answers](./../who-picks-expiration-dates).
