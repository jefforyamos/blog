In Jeremiah 16:14-15, there is a very interesting prophecy:

> “Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it shall no longer be said, ‘As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’but ‘As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.’ For I will bring them back to their own land that I gave to their fathers.

What??? There is going to be a deliverance to happen in the future?  And that deliverance will be SO MIRACULOUS that nobody will talk about the deliverance from Egypt any more?  They'll be talking about *this one instead*??
