There is a doctrine that is often stated:

> Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.

Though the primary source is Hebrews 9:22, secondary sources for the doctrine would be Ephesians 1:7 and Matthew 26:28.

The problem arises when a story emerges in which *God Incarnate* himself *breaks* this rule. In the story of the paralytic, there is no shedding of blood an any of the accounts.

- Matthew 9:1-8
- Mark 2:1-12
- Luke 5:17-26
- John 5:8-9

No sheep was offered. No goat. No bullock.  
We don't even see [repentence](./../paralytic-repentence-missing).
And Jesus had not yet gone to the cross.
We find this foundational requirement simply ignored in the story.
