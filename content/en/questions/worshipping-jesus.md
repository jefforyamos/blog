description: "Should Jesus be worshipped? Early Christianity says no. Most notably, even Jesus said no, citing God's Torah as precluding it. Why then is the church hymnal about 99% songs that worship Jesus with almost zero that worship Yehovah?"

Who should be **worshipped** according to the Christian Bible?

- In Matthew 2:2-8, people from foreign religions found it appropriate to worship baby Jesus. There is no record of anyone preventing them.
- In Matthew 4:10, Jesus expressed that God ONLY was to be worshipped because God's laws demanded it.
- In Matthew 15:7-9, Mark 7:6-7 and Luke 4:7-8 Jesus quoted Isaiah where God demanded worship that is sincere.
- Jesus tells the woman at the well "worship the Father" in John 4:22-24.  
- In Acts 7:7, Stephen the martyr cited worship of God with no mention of worshipping Jesus.
