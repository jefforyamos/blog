description: "After 15 years of the spreading of Christianity, the Jerusalem church still suggested ongoing education at synagogues on the weekly Sabbath rather than church on Sunday, and they still fully endorsed the law of Moses the modern church calls 'a curse' and 'bondage'. Why does the modern church have such different standards than those that KNEW Jesus personally?"

When the Jerusalem church met to discuss what was required of Gentile believers, they decided on a four-item list as a set of basic requirements for new converts. Acts 15:19-21.

> Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.

The four items on their list:

- abstain from things polluted by idols
- abstain from sexual immorality
- don't eat animals that have been strangled
- don't eat blood

Was this inclusive of everything a believer in Jesus needed to know forever, for the remainder of their life?  Of course not. It was a *getting started* sort of list.

Where were they to get the rest?  The answer is surprising.

This happened in approximately 48-50, roughly 15 to 25 years after the crucifixion of Jesus. There were churches established in many cities. Paul had already started writing letters to some of them. There were several thousands of believers at that time.  Given that backdrop, I might expect a statement like this:

> Each of these cities have churches, and converts can learn the rest of the doctrine at **any church** on **any Sunday**.

But, that's not what they said. Instead they said this:

> For from ancient generations **Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him**, for he is **read every Sabbath in the synagogues**.

Things that would NOT be expected if the ancient church was like the modern church:

- Instead of prescribing church for continuing education, they are prescribing the reading of "Moses", what we call the "Old Testament".
- Instead of prescribing attendance of churches, they prescribe synagogues. 
- Instead of prescribing Sunday, they prescribe the Sabbath.

Apparently, those that knew Jesus and were kinfolk with Jesus did not consider "the law" or "Moses" being "done away with" as modern churches. Belief in Jesus did not at that time mandate a rejection of the "old law".
