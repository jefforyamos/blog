description: "Why does Paul practice fund raising like a TV evangelist when Jesus prohibits it?  Why was there one set of rules for twelve apostles, and another set of rules for the self-appointed thirteenth one?"
bible: true

Jesus first sent his twelve Apostles on **The Great Commission**, this time to Jews only, in Matthew 10:5-10. He prescribed a certain behavior for them to follow. This included a prohibition on fundraising:

- You received without paying, give without paying.
- Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts.

While Paul was self-declared as an Apostle likewise, he had different behavior.  

- He dedicated an entire chapter, Phillippians 4 to the subject of fund raising.
- Like a cheesy TV preacher, he promised spiritual compensation for monetary donations. See Phillippians 4:17.
- Like a TV preacher, he freely repurposed phrases (Phillippians 4:18) from the laws of God using them as buzzwords to give a sense of divine endorsement:
  - A fragrant offering.
  - An acceptable sacrifice.
- He promised in return for their money, "God will supply all their needs" in return for the money they send their evangelist. (Phillippians 4:19)
- He chided churches publicly like Macedonia that didn't pull their weight, while publicly praising the high donors. (Phillippians 4:15)
- Like a TV preacher, he spoke of donors "partnering with him" in Phillippians 4:14.
- He received their gift as a "renewal" of his care, implying he expected them to resume paying on a regular basis. (Phillippians 4:10-11).
- He makes it sound like he suffered through the period in which their payment lapsed (Phillippians 4:12-14)

Some insist that Paul was only collecting enough for meager travel expenses, but [there are several reasons](./../is-paul-a-fundraiser/) why this is improbable.

Contrast this for a moment with the original twelve Apostles.  Do you think they had to ask for anything? Do you think they had to lean on anyone?

If Paul had set the same example Jesus's true Apostles did, would Kenneth Copeland have all those private jets and mansions?
