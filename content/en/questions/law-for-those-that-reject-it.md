In 1 Timothy 1:5-10, Paul speaks of a few doctrines he embraces, then switches to condemnation of his ideological enemies:

> Certain persons, by swerving from these [doctrines], have wandered away into vain discussion, desiring to be **teachers of the law**, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions. Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, 
understanding this, that **the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient**, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine.

Well, Paul being educated at the "feet of Gamaliel", I'm sure we can flip right to Torah and find where Yehovah gave the law for people **not to follow** and for people that **refused it**, right?

Well, not exactly....

From Deuteronomy 4:1-10, we see the following:

- Deu 4:3-4 clearly says he is delivering his laws to those who "held fast to the LORD your God". 
  - Paul's claim it was given to the "unholy and profane" is clearly wrong.
  - The ones with character Paul described were previously destroyed at Baal-peor. 
- Deu 4:1 clearly says he gives it to them not so they can do all the wrong things as in Paul's list, but so they can succeed and "live".
- Deu 4:6 says they will be seen as an amazing "great nation" as a result. Not "liars" and "purjuers" and "homosexuals" as Paul lists. Those with "wisdom" and "understanding".

The entire passage is probably exactly what Paul's ideological enemies were saying.  What kind of audacity would entice a man to reverse this the way Paul has? Yes, I would expect Paul would indeed clash with every "teacher of the law" he encountered, including those at Jerusalem. It sounds like we're better off listening to Paul's adversaries that were making "confident assertions" that made him angry.

According to Paul, God made his laws for those that reject it, not for those like David that accept it, and *carefully follow it* as "lamp unto my feet, and light unto my path".

If I said, "**Jello** is made for people who **don't** eat it", would you believe that?

If I said, "**Cars** are made for people who **refuse to drive**", would you swallow that one?

How could any theological statement be more preposterous?
