description: "Why is the 'confess with thy mouth' approach to salvation most often used when Jesus directly refutes it?  When Jesus specified the qualifications much more restrictive, was he misinformed?  Was he less qualified on the subject than Paul?"

If you've ever heard an "altar call" in a Baptist church, it almost always concludes with Romans 10:9:

> That if thou shalt **confess with thy mouth** the Lord Jesus, and shalt **believe*** in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou **shalt be saved**.

The statement is absolute. There's no *maybe* in the context.

So what's the problem?

Well, the problem is that Jesus disputes it in Matthew 7:21-23.

> Not every one that **saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter** into the kingdom of heaven; but **he that doeth the will of my Father** which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

Jesus seems to think there is an additional requirement. To obey him?  No, to obey Yehovah.  

It would be hard to convince someone that "prophesied in thy name" that they did not *believe in their heart* as Romans requires.

So, one story from Paul, another from Jesus.
