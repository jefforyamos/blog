## Psalm 78 made predictions about Jesus!

Matthew tells us that Jesus' strict adherence to teaching through parables "fulfilled" what was prophesied in Psalm 78. However, when we look at that psalm, we don't find doctrines that fit modern Christianity at all.

### The prophecy in Psalm 78:2

> **I will open my mouth in a parable:**  I will utter **dark sayings** of old: 

### The fulfillment in Matthew 13:35

> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, **I will open my mouth in parables;** I will utter **things which have been kept secret** from the foundation of the world.

Where Matthew quotes the psalm is not exact, but since "dark sayings" [H2420](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2420/kjv/wlc/0-1/) is usually related to a riddle or perplexing question, it is seemingly acceptable to call this "things which have been kept secret". The translated "from the foundation of the world" seems to correspond to the original "of old". It would seem for this verse, we have a match.

### Wait, not so fast, they're *not secret*!

The "dark sayings of old" are not *secret* as Matthew alleges. How do we know? By reading the very next verse. They are not locked away in a vault only to be revealed upon the birth of Jesus.

> Which **we have heard and known**, and **our fathers have told us**. **We will not hide them** from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. Psalm 78:3-4.  

Certainly the above is reminiscent of Deuteronomy 30:10-14 when Yehovah made it perfectly clear this information was **not hidden**.  

He elaborates giving the reasons **why** he does such a thing:

> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should *make them known to their children*:  That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and *declare them to their children*: That they might **set their hope in God**, and **not forget the works of God**, but **keep his commandments**: Psalm 78:5-7

Why does the author of Matthew want you to think this psalm references knowledge that is "secret from the foundation of the earth" and can only be revealed a thousand years later by Jesus?  Why would it be represented that way when the original text itself so explicitly says otherwise?

### Keeping the law

Psalm 78:1 says we should listen to "my law".  But what is that? Just any law that comes along? Roman law? Tennessee law? Consulting the original language, the word translated "law" in the KJV english is actually a very specific law in Hebrew. It's [H8451 in Strong's](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/). Seems peculiar if Jesus came to "fulfill" the "burden" of the "old law" that the passage that allegedly predicts this puts those very words in his mouth.

Psalm 78:5 makes it very clear it's not some future law, but the law given at Sinai. Psalm 78:5 makes it even clearer the *law* is the one given to Jacob and Israel. It recounts how they were commanded to pass them along to their children.  

Psalm 78:8-10 makes it clear the "stubborn and rebellious" have a trait. They "refuse to walk in his law". Yet Christianity prides itself not "under the law" even though Jesus says in Matthew 7:21-23 and Matthew 5:17-20 this behavior excludes them from the kingdom.

Not only is this "dark saying" to be understood by those at Sinai. They are to be understood by all generations afterward, even the family of Jesus in the first century. The original psalm presents us with a stark contrast to Galatians 2:21 that implies Yehovah is insulted by someone keeping the law.

### Salvation is literal, not metaphorical

Another stark contrast with Christianity is the concept of salvation. Instead of being a metaphorical "confesss with thy mouth" mental or philosophical salvation in the abstract, the salvation in the psalm is extremely literal. The water parted to save the chosen while it swallowed their enemies. The *living water* of the Psalm 78:20 was literal water to drink, not metaphorical water as in John 4:10.  

### Covenants

In Psalm 78:37, they were expected to be "steadfast in the covenant". The opposite can be found in Ephesians 2:8-9 where everything is required of one party, and zero required from the other party. This is in spite of Psalm 78:10 making it clear failing to keep the covenant is possible.

Psalm 78:8-11 profiles "stubborn and rebellious". We would expect him to describe here having faith instead of *vain works*, right?  But no, he describes people resembling Christians, that did not walk in the commandments of God, outright *refusing*.  

Psalm 78:12-21 expresses the righteous indignation those that accepted his salvation but refused to walk in his ways. Does Jesus agree with this?
