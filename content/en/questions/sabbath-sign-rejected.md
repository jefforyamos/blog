In Exodus 31:13, Yehovah declares the following:

> Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily **my sabbaths ye shall keep**: for **it is a sign** between me and you **throughout your generations**; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.

It is further emphasized in Ezekiel 20:12-20.  

It's easy to demonstrate both Jesus and the early church observed Sabbaths both before and after his ascension:

- [x] Jesus Matthew 26:18, Matthew 12:12, Mark 1:21
- [x] Jerusalem church Acts 13:14, Acts 13:42, Acts 13:44, Acts 15:21
- [x] Paul Acts 18:21 (Feast of Tabernacles), Acts 17:2, Acts 18:4

Jesus made it clear he expected Sabbaths to be continuing when end-time events occurred in Matthew 24:20.

But, in spite of all this, straight out of the chute, just a few decades into it's existence, what is Christianity hell-bent on doing?  Getting rid of the Sabbath using any flimsy excuse they could find. Why would this be?  Is there a spiritual reason for this inexplicable compulsion?  Why were they intent on removal of this *sign* from their new faith system?
