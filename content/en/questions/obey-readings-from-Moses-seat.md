In Matthew 23:1-3, Jesus is quoted saying:

> Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on **Moses’ seat**, so **do and observe whatever they tell you**, but not the works they do....

What specifically is read from Moses' seat? (hint, think who's buried in Grant's tomb). The law of God as delivered to Moses of course!

Is it possible that Christians think God's law is a *burden*, and *schoolmaster* and *against us* because of something Paul says?  

If so, who is greater, Paul or Jesus?
