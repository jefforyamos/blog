These are somewhat random articles I've "put to paper" as I think of them. I'm human, I don't profess any divine empowerment. These questions are constructed from my own study with a hope of enlightenment my own prayer.  I recommend you question everything, and that includes me. (yeah, I know, I don't have the contact page working yet...sorry).

I'm creating these articles as "single conversation sized" bites. I anticipate this being a collection that grows over time.  I intent to make them friendly to print. I intend to 

I recommend the following decorum:

- If you ask them in a group, make sure they fit the context of the current teaching.  Don't be the guy that hijacks the lesson the teacher worked hard to prepare.
- If asked one-on-one, it's best asked with fewer people.  
- Be respectful. There are many emotions tied to matters of religion. Starting a fight benefits nobody. These aren't weapons.
- Be willing to accept and lovingly embrace, "I don't know" for an answer. That's the most honest any of us can give sometimes. No spiritual leader can arrive knowing every answer to every question.
- If someone gets emotional and insults you, don't return anger with anger. Try to emphasize with the emotions being felt by the other person as they feel some portion of their religion is being "attacked".  
- No shaming. These are not tools to put somebody on the spot and make them look foolish. Be sure your motive is purely constructive dialogue.

Obviously, I can't make anybody do anything.  This is just a statement of my wishes and my intent.
