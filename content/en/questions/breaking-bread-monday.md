description: "If the significant doctrinal justification for abandoning Sabbath in favor of Sunday worship hangs upon the Pauline at Troas visit, if their example demands significant doctrinal changes, then one would expect consistency. Why is the church dogmatic about the Sunday 'breaking bread', and dismissive of the Monday morning 'breaking bread' mentioned in the same exact text? Is this not hypocritical?"

There is no New Testament commandment to stop keeping the Sabbath, the fourth of the Ten Commandments.  There is no commandment to start worshipping instead on Sunday.  The alleged reason tends to sound like this:

> The followers of Jesus in Jerusalem had communion on Sunday, so we follow their tradition.

Indeed, in Acts 20:6-7, in Paul's visit to Troas, there is a mention of "breaking bread".  Christianity supposes that since we refer to the Sunday Euchrist or Communion ceremony today by that term today, then by necessity, it *must* have been called that back then.  

So, let's just concede for the moment that *breaking bread* means having a communion ceremony.

Well, everything is fine and good. Communion on Sunday.  The only problem is, the story didn't end there. It continues with a small mishap. The sequence of events is this:

- Sunday during day - **breaking of bread** Acts 20:7
- Paul preaches until midnight on Sunday night - Acts 20:7
- Monday wee hours of the morning - Eutychus falls out the window, almost dies - Acts 20:8-10
- Eutychus is revived.
- Monday morning - They **broke bread again**.  Acts 20:11. Read it for yourself.

According to this account, whatever "breaking bread" is, they did it twice.  Once on Sunday, once on Monday.
